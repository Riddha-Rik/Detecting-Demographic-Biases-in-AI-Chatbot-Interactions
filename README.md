# Detecting-Demographic-Biases-in-AI-Chatbot-Interactions
An end-to-end Python pipeline detecting demographic bias in AI career advice. Using a synthetic dataset of 100 profiles (names/pycountry), I performed sentiment analysis via TextBlob and trained a Scikit-Learn regression model. Found a significant age-based bias (coeff: -0.0148), proving AI gives less encouraging advice as age increases.
